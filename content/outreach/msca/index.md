We demonstrated our project " robot that learns how to perform language instructions" in  ‘Science is Wonder-ful!’, on September 26-27 2018. Our project shows the ability of robots to understand spoken instructions which was working a noisy condition.You can see more details [*here*]({{< ref "project/instructing_arm_robot" >}}).
