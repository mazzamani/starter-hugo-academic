I am a Senior Machine Learning Applied Scientist at Hamburg Informatics Technology Center (HITeC) and a Research Associate at University of Hamburg. I am passionate to find scalable solutions based on deep learning for industrial problems. My research focus has been on deep (reinforcement) learning including explainability and its applications in robotics, dialogue management systems, and planning. I am also interested in AutoML as a path to reach a scalable artificial intelligence solution.
