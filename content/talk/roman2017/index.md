 I presented our work on [*Deep Reinforcement Learning using Symbolic Representation for Performing Spoken Language Instructions*]({{<ref "publication/roman2017">}}) at 2nd Workshop on Behavior Adaptation, Interaction and Learning for Assistive Robotics (BAILAR). This workshop was part of the 26th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN).
