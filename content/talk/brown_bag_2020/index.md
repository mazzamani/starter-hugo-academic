I was invited as speaker to the Remote Brown Bag Sessions which are orginized by Artificial Intelligence Center Hamburg (ARIC). In this talk, I presented our work on Continuous Acoustic Emotion Classification which we could reduce latency and improve the accuracy for critical cases. You can find  the list of talks orginized by ARIC [*here*](https://github.com/aric-hamburg/remote-brown-bag-sessions).
