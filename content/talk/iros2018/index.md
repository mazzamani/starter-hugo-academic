 I jointly presented our paper [*On the Robustness of Speech Emotion Recognition for Human-Robot Interaction with Deep Neural Networks*]({{<ref "publication/iros2018">}}) during the interactive section. Also, on the last day of the conference, I attended the *Machine Learning in Robot Motion Planning* workshop to present our work on [*Neural End-to-End Learning of Reach for Grasp Ability with a 6-DoF Robot Arm*]({{<ref "publication/iros2018_ws">}}).
